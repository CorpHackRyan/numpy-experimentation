<p>Man we had a lot of people lose this week including myself. I'm back to even but hey this ain't about me. KUDOS to you guys for continuing to lose this far
into the challenge. We have just 2 weeks left, lets make them count! I'll be sending out a separate text for the next competition for those who are interested,
and feel free to invite anyone of your friends along to juice up the prize pool. It will be paid out differently next time (Most likely the top 3 of just pounds
lost. Keep the focus the next two weeks and see you guys at the finish line!

at this LOL. Someday! HA! Anyway, I'm going to hit you all up with a text message this week for the next competition with some new rules and ideas. Hoping we can all continue on this journey
together and keep at trying to get healthy! Til then have a good rest of your week!</p>

<p>Thanks for continued participation from all! I know it's probably one of the more difficult things to stick to and follow with life going on. I hope I can get more involved in the next one,
as I have some ideas I'll be pitching. As always, I'm just proud of all of you for continuing to maintain or lose your weight. Personal physical health should be HIGH UP on the priority list
of things to focus on in life. My opinion anyway. Til next week!

<h1>Blog Entry #9<br> Monday - February 28th @ 12:34 PM</h1>
<p>Alright! Killing it this week. I'm feeling great and ready to have another awesome week this week. Finally found some motivation to stick to my diet and get moving. Only
took me 7 weeks! LOL. I havent' heard from anyone regarding continuing on after this - but I'm going to do it anyway. I think while we all have it in our minds to lose weight,
it's probably beneficial to us all to keep this thing going. Good luck this week! Drink water, don't eat crap, move as much as you can, and enjoy life!

<p>Alright! You guys all did great this week. We are heading into week #7 now, which means we are over the halfway point and have about 5 and a half weeks left to go. If there was a ever a time
to pick it up and start crushing, now is the time! I'm thinking of keeping this one going even after the April 3rd is up.. you know, do another competition to keep the momentum that
we've built up going for the next 3 months. Let me know your thoughts on that. Otherwise, good luck all this week and hope to continue to see those numbers drop!</p>

<p>Hey everyone! Apologize for the late update. I'm writing new code to retrieve the data and store it so it's still a work in progress. Hopefully before the end of the contest
I'll be able to utilize it LOL. Nice work everyone! As a whole we all killed it last week and everyone lost some weight. That's the first. Hopefully it trend continues this week!
Good luck to you all as always!</p>

<p>Congrats to Greg and Mike B right now for absolutely crushing the top two spots! I'm determined to get out of the bottom LOL. Hope you guys have a great week and continue on

<p>Hey guys! I stunk this week! Adding 2 more pounds. I've dropped to last place. LOL. Most of us had a breakeven week this week and I"m guessing the storm we got
had something to do with it. I'm finding it somewhat difficult to reduce my caloric intake here to. Exercise has been decent but I keep shoving garbage down my throat. <br><br>
I am to take a pledge this week to do the best I can to eat as healthy as I can and get as much movement as I can. This is about longevity. That means making small
incremental changes that will last forever. Are you with me?!?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190415200241.htm">What does your resting heart rate say about you?</a> <br><br>
    And what does your present resting heart rate say about your future self? High blood pressure, stress, anxiety, lack of exercise and being overweight
    - are just a few of the things that can increase your resting heart rate. And according to the study above, a resting heart rate higher than 75 beats per
    minute (bpm) can increase your risk of early death by a combined 57%! Your resting heart rate is one way to determine your overall physical health. And
    improving your physical health, diet and exercise scientifically will improve your chances at longevity in this life.

<p>Alright guys, week #2 down! Keep up the good work! Got a LONG way to go. I'm trying to come up with a cool idea to keep us all engaged weekly,
    so we can keep our head in the game. Motivation can go away quickly. I have a few ideas that I'll run by everyone but going to let them stew a little longer.
    Everyone's profile has been updated with each submission. Just click on your name to see more details regarding your stats. At some point this week, I'll end
    up having some cool statistics break down of us collectively as a group. If you see something off, just let me know. Good luck this week!

<p> Hey everyone! First week down. Hopefully everyone got through the week with no issues. I personally sucked LOL. Anyway, the real tough
    issue in my experience with weight loss competitions is staying motivated. So, stick to it, remind yourself why you're doing it. There's SO many
    health benefits to losing fat/weight. Did you know that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm">#1 leading cause of death
    </a>in America currently is Heart Disease? <br><br>Being overweight, no exercise, eating a bad diet and lack of movement all contribute to this. (For reference,
    COVID-19 is third on the list of leading cause of death). Not to mention being overweight contributes to high blood pressure which increases your chances of
    a stroke - or death. I've always been a big advocate for staying in shape. But it doesn't happen overnight. Just like getting over weight doesn't happen over night
    either. I sincerely hope all of you can make some lifestyle changes that will stick and lead to a happier healthy you!
    <br><br>Good luck this week!
    Also, Don't forget to check out the <a href="#helpful">Helpful Links section. </a>There's a TON of good information to sift through.

<h1>Blog entry #1<br> Sunday - January 9th, 2022 @ 09:30 AM</h1>
<p>
    HAPPY SUNDAY! Welcome to DAY 1 of the weight loss competition and our initial weigh in!
    Since today will be our first weigh in, please send me a screenshot of your scale ONLY. You will need to weigh in NAKED to get an
    accurate measurement. I none need to see anything else besides your scale and your feet, thanks 🙏 LOL.
    <br><br>
    After today, you'll send me your weight every Sunday. I'll have the option to submit directly from the website, which will contain
    all the data for the overall group and individual data as well.
    Once I get your submission, that will finalize your entry, and you'll be on the hook $100. It's up to you if you want to pay now or
    square up on the last day. I have PayPal/Venmo/CashApp - whichever you prefer.
    <br><br>This is based entirely off the honor system, and I appreciate everyone doing their part to stick to that. The money incentive
    is to just keep us on track and add a little competition amongst friends.
    Good luck and I'm really looking forward to doing this with you all!</p>
